# tagurl
An aspnetcore 3.0 webservice to suggest tags for urls

## Goal

This is mostly playground to get a feel for some of the more recent apis, and other parts I don't use that often:
- pipelines
- new json implementation in .net core 3
- raw http request/response usage
- http client (instead of RestClient)
